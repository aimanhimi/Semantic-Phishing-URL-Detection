# Phishing URL Detection with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Machine Learning-based approach to detect phishing URLs using semantic URL-based features. The project is based on the PhiUSIIL dataset and emphasizes deriving meaningful insights from URL anatomy without relying on HTML content nor online content.
